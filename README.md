## MAE-207-Reduced-order-Modeling-Class-Project
# Reduced-order modeling for fast computational analysis of hyperelastic materials

# Installation
- RBniCs first from https://github.com/mathLab/RBniCS

# There are mainly three problems that we consider to solve
- 3D static elastic problem with stiffness, body, traction forces changing in the POD snapshots (finished)

- 3D dynamic elastic problem with stiffness, body, traction forces changing in the POD snapshots (in progress)
  . Note: this is a user-defined hyperbolic problem in RBniCs, which could be genralized to any 3D dynamic elastic problem     given the imported mesh (tentatively trying the meshio for unstructured geometry)
  
  - 3D dynamic hyperelastic problem with stiffness, body, traction forces changing in the POD snapshots (in progress)
